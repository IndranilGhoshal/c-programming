Stack in C

Stack is the linear data structure that follows the Last in, First Out(LIFO) principle of data insertion and deletion. It means that the element that is inserted last will be the first one to be removed and the element that is inserted first will be removed at last. Think of it as the stack of plates stacked on top of one another where we can only add or remove the top plate.

Stacks are widely used in programming for tasks like expression evaluation, function call management, and backtracking algorithms. In this article, we will learn how to implement a stack in the C programming language. We will also look at some of its basic operations along with their time and space complexity analysis.



Implementation of a Stack in C

In C, we can implement a stack using an array or a linked list. In this article, we will use the array data structure to store the stack elements and use a pointer to keep track of the topmost element of the stack. The stack will offer some basic operations like push, pop, peek, isEmpty, and isFull to the users.
